# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
 
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) in spirit, but in reality major backward-compatibility-breaking changes are made between MINOR versions.
PATCH versions generally don't break interfaces.
I'm trying to get better about that.
